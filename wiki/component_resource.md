# Component Resource
* A resource in Pulumi terms is basically a building block.
* That building block could be a base component like an **``s3.Bucket``** object that’s managed by external providers like your favorite cloud provider. Alternatively, a resource could be a group of other resources that implements abstraction and encapsulation for reasons like defining a common pattern. This latter type of resource is called a Component Resource in Pulumi’s terminology.
